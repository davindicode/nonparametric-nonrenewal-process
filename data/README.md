The dataset original files are downloaded from [CRCNR.org](https://crcns.org/).

We use the 'th1' and 'hc3' datasets, in particular the specific sessions:
- (th1) mouse ID: 28, session ID: 140313
- (hc3) session ID: ec014.468, recording ID: ec014.29
    
Commands for generating synthetic data and preprocessing data from the original files are in ```data.sh```.

# Bayesian nonparametric (non-)renewal processes

See notebooks in `notebooks/` for a basic usage overview.
See `scripts/` for model fitting, analysis and plotting code.


## Motivation


TODO:
- Inset of rate maps from 5D, with 3 ISIs on the side

- plot the tuning for baseline models, and ISIs as well
- Try plot the tunings of baseline models too, e.g. rate and CV of those models... if time permits, use conditional with same past spike as the one used for that

- put library subset in and change path imports
